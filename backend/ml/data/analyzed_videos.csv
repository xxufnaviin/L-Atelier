2kyS6SvSYSE,CaseyNeistat,WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE,2017-11-13 17:13:01+00:00,677,https://youtube.com/watch?v=2kyS6SvSYSE,57527,,15954,748374,youtube," Canis and I are headed to our therapy, our couples therapy session right now. I had an idea that I wanted to talk to you about and get your opinion on. We're thinking about doing a podcast, a Casey and Candice podcast that's like I don't know like an hour long or a half an hour long or something and calling it the title is the best part, calling it therapy where it's just us talking. Are you, are you, are you already not a podcasting therapy? There probably is but we can just make our bigger and better and then brush the competition. So let us know you think like if that's a terrible idea just write terrible idea below. If you'd be interested in all. Well the only thing is that I'm tired of hearing the comments that I'm such a like bitch in the dark. I think people... We're at therapy now but that's the idea. Let us, let us know what you think. We finished therapy. How do you think today went? I feel like we need another hour from that topic. Today in therapy we talked about having more children and whether or not we want to move to California. We should do the podcast. I would like to. So long. We're taking your clothes off. The new Billy Cash, my son. Nice boxy cut. Go to billylovebillynyc.com and buy Candice's new cashmere sweater. It's a little expensive for my audience honey. $180 for pure cashmere. Bye honey. Check this out. Ready I want to show this to you. So you got a screw here. You got a string here. Now on the other end there's like this pin that can be used to remove SIM cards. I have permanently attached this to my desk. Now this may seem like I'm nothing but you know I change cell phones all the time and getting that little SIM tray out as a nightmare on my phone here when I want to get my memory card out to offload all the videos and stuff. It's hard to get out and I can never find this thing. And now look, just live us here. I don't know. This is exciting for me. I'm going to be premiering a new video that I made that I've been working on for a long time. I'm going to put it in this vlog. It's like a four minute video. It's going to be part of this vlog. You see one thing I want to do a lot more on this channel is talk about creators, other creators that I really like that I think you should follow that I think maybe you'll be interested in. And the video that I made is about my friend Chantal who you've seen in this show before and she just started YouTubeing. So I want to premiere her new movie on my channel even though it's going to live on her channel. I want to use this channel and I want to use like this big audience that this channel has to talk about smaller creators. She's brand new. She's got any subscribers and to talk about other people that I think are doing amazing things in this platform and try to sort of elevate them a little bit. Try a little spotlight on them. Were you trapped outside? I was trapped outside. I'm so sorry. Did you turn off the bus? I turned off the bus but it should still work. So this is my friend Chantal. Chantal is a fine artist. Do you go by that? Do you want this? Are this fine? Are this fine? And the reason why I like Chantal so much as an artist, the reason why I like her as a person is because she's cool. The reason why I like her as an artist is because her only instrument, her only actually have one of your pens. Her entire art career was built with a pen. Just a pen. Look, this is my apartment and then this is, I have one of Chantal's paintings in my apartment. That's for insane. I have one of the apartments. A couple years ago I had a studio here. But we were friends before that, yeah. She had one of the best studios. She had one of the studios in this building that had a skylight. You almost took it. I was going to take it. It's just like four flights away. I don't want to go up all those stairs. I've always wanted to make a movie about Chantal and her artwork and who she is because she's such an interesting human being. And we were kind of given the excuse actually from Sam's. Whoops. You got a sticker there too. Yeah, this is one of Chantal's stickers. We're given the opportunity because of Sam's song. Part of their creator, creator, initiative is enabling us to make movies and they were willing to produce a Casey Neistat movie about Chantal Martin. And I'm going to premiere that movie. I'm wondering where I should drop it. Let me finish. Let's finish. Okay, let's we're finished. And then it'll play. Cool. I'm reviving my old YouTube channel that I started probably 10, 11, 12 years ago right at the beginning. And I forgot I had it actually. One thing that I will say about Chantal is she is fearless about trying new things. It's like I see everything is a blank canvas so you shouldn't be afraid of it. You should flip that switch and then just use it as a challenge and create whatever you want. How did you meet Kendrick Lamar? Stop. In Miami last year. How did you meet Puff Daddy? He came to show I had a few years ago. He probably doesn't remember. Okay, so without further ado, I'm going this is the world YouTube premiere of a Chantal by Casey video. It's like three minutes long but I'm really excited. You're the first people to see this ever. Ready? Three, two, one. So what's the point in making art? The point is to make so you can share. So you make and share and you make and share and you make and share. I'm Chantal Martin and I draw. I'm drawing on canvases, I'm drawing on walls, I'm drawing on cars, I'm drawing on shirts, I'm drawing on shoes. 99% of that is done live. When you're drawing live, you have no time to think, you have no time to hesitate, you have no time to plan, you have no time to beat anyone else. So this is the cover of the home and garden section and it's funny, I didn't know it was a big deal at the time so I only bought one copy. So if you have an extra spare copy out there, I take it. I remember my art teacher, Telle Michantel, don't apply for art school because you're not good enough and you won't get in. At that point people were only telling me what I couldn't do so I ran away. I started my career in Japan in a culture that was craft based, in a culture where people learn things and practice things over generations, over long periods of time and I remember thinking to myself, what can I master in my lifetime? What could I become profoundly confident with? What about a light? You know, I draw, I love drawing. So with these and these, I'm going to draw like this. What kind of hard work and patience would it take so that when I draw a line is recognisably mine? Moving to York was very humbling because if no one knows who you are, they don't care who you are and everyone is an artist and you start to lose yourself, you start to lose your way and so I decided, well I'm not going to not make art because you won't show it. I'm going to draw and make the world my canvas and I'm going to lose any drawing tool that I can get my hands up. I'm going to draw and I'm going to draw and I'm going to draw and I'm going to draw and I'm going to share and share and share and share and share and draw. Just give me a pen and I'll make something. We follow the pen and you allow it to flow and you allow it to go wherever it needs to go, wherever it wants to take you. You are a willing passenger. And now you repeat that and you repeat that and you repeat that and you repeat that. Over time you get to extract what you look like. Over time you get to extract what your line feels like, coming that recognisably yours. We have this contact between our head and our hand. It does a matter of what industry you're in. It comes down to drawing, it comes down to that initial mark that you make and without this pen I wouldn't have travelled, I wouldn't have collaborated. This tool has allowed me to discover who I am. Goodbye. Did you like our movie? We worked really hard on that, I hope you enjoyed it. What are your most nervous about when it comes to being a YouTuber? I think what I'm most nervous about is continuously making and sharing and you know pulling out stuff that I'm proud of and pulling out stuff that you're proud of too. You make and you share and you make and you want to make and share and make and share and make and share. Alright, I'm going to link Shantel's channel below. Check it out, she's new, there's not a lot of stuff up there yet but it's happening. I'm a big supporter and a huge fan and I hope you guys will. You should sell those stickers, you could binkle your entire... Stick a pack, coming soon. Coming soon.",['SHANtell martin'],0.9995
