2kyS6SvSYSE,CaseyNeistat,WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE,2017-11-13 17:13:01+00:00,677,https://youtube.com/watch?v=2kyS6SvSYSE,57527,,15954,748374,youtube," Canis and I are headed to our therapy, our couples therapy session right now. I had an idea that I wanted to talk to you about and get your opinion on. We're thinking about doing a podcast, a Casey and Candice podcast that's like I don't know like an hour long or a half an hour long or something and calling it the title is the best part, calling it therapy where it's just us talking. Are you, are you, are you already not a podcasting therapy? There probably is but we can just make our bigger and better and then brush the competition. So let us know you think like if that's a terrible idea just write terrible idea below. If you'd be interested in all. Well the only thing is that I'm tired of hearing the comments that I'm such a like bitch in the dark. I think people... We're at therapy now but that's the idea. Let us, let us know what you think. We finished therapy. How do you think today went? I feel like we need another hour from that topic. Today in therapy we talked about having more children and whether or not we want to move to California. We should do the podcast. I would like to. So long. We're taking your clothes off. The new Billy Cash, my son. Nice boxy cut. Go to billylovebillynyc.com and buy Candice's new cashmere sweater. It's a little expensive for my audience honey. $180 for pure cashmere. Bye honey. Check this out. Ready I want to show this to you. So you got a screw here. You got a string here. Now on the other end there's like this pin that can be used to remove SIM cards. I have permanently attached this to my desk. Now this may seem like I'm nothing but you know I change cell phones all the time and getting that little SIM tray out as a nightmare on my phone here when I want to get my memory card out to offload all the videos and stuff. It's hard to get out and I can never find this thing. And now look, just live us here. I don't know. This is exciting for me. I'm going to be premiering a new video that I made that I've been working on for a long time. I'm going to put it in this vlog. It's like a four minute video. It's going to be part of this vlog. You see one thing I want to do a lot more on this channel is talk about creators, other creators that I really like that I think you should follow that I think maybe you'll be interested in. And the video that I made is about my friend Chantal who you've seen in this show before and she just started YouTubeing. So I want to premiere her new movie on my channel even though it's going to live on her channel. I want to use this channel and I want to use like this big audience that this channel has to talk about smaller creators. She's brand new. She's got any subscribers and to talk about other people that I think are doing amazing things in this platform and try to sort of elevate them a little bit. Try a little spotlight on them. Were you trapped outside? I was trapped outside. I'm so sorry. Did you turn off the bus? I turned off the bus but it should still work. So this is my friend Chantal. Chantal is a fine artist. Do you go by that? Do you want this? Are this fine? Are this fine? And the reason why I like Chantal so much as an artist, the reason why I like her as a person is because she's cool. The reason why I like her as an artist is because her only instrument, her only actually have one of your pens. Her entire art career was built with a pen. Just a pen. Look, this is my apartment and then this is, I have one of Chantal's paintings in my apartment. That's for insane. I have one of the apartments. A couple years ago I had a studio here. But we were friends before that, yeah. She had one of the best studios. She had one of the studios in this building that had a skylight. You almost took it. I was going to take it. It's just like four flights away. I don't want to go up all those stairs. I've always wanted to make a movie about Chantal and her artwork and who she is because she's such an interesting human being. And we were kind of given the excuse actually from Sam's. Whoops. You got a sticker there too. Yeah, this is one of Chantal's stickers. We're given the opportunity because of Sam's song. Part of their creator, creator, initiative is enabling us to make movies and they were willing to produce a Casey Neistat movie about Chantal Martin. And I'm going to premiere that movie. I'm wondering where I should drop it. Let me finish. Let's finish. Okay, let's we're finished. And then it'll play. Cool. I'm reviving my old YouTube channel that I started probably 10, 11, 12 years ago right at the beginning. And I forgot I had it actually. One thing that I will say about Chantal is she is fearless about trying new things. It's like I see everything is a blank canvas so you shouldn't be afraid of it. You should flip that switch and then just use it as a challenge and create whatever you want. How did you meet Kendrick Lamar? Stop. In Miami last year. How did you meet Puff Daddy? He came to show I had a few years ago. He probably doesn't remember. Okay, so without further ado, I'm going this is the world YouTube premiere of a Chantal by Casey video. It's like three minutes long but I'm really excited. You're the first people to see this ever. Ready? Three, two, one. So what's the point in making art? The point is to make so you can share. So you make and share and you make and share and you make and share. I'm Chantal Martin and I draw. I'm drawing on canvases, I'm drawing on walls, I'm drawing on cars, I'm drawing on shirts, I'm drawing on shoes. 99% of that is done live. When you're drawing live, you have no time to think, you have no time to hesitate, you have no time to plan, you have no time to beat anyone else. So this is the cover of the home and garden section and it's funny, I didn't know it was a big deal at the time so I only bought one copy. So if you have an extra spare copy out there, I take it. I remember my art teacher, Telle Michantel, don't apply for art school because you're not good enough and you won't get in. At that point people were only telling me what I couldn't do so I ran away. I started my career in Japan in a culture that was craft based, in a culture where people learn things and practice things over generations, over long periods of time and I remember thinking to myself, what can I master in my lifetime? What could I become profoundly confident with? What about a light? You know, I draw, I love drawing. So with these and these, I'm going to draw like this. What kind of hard work and patience would it take so that when I draw a line is recognisably mine? Moving to York was very humbling because if no one knows who you are, they don't care who you are and everyone is an artist and you start to lose yourself, you start to lose your way and so I decided, well I'm not going to not make art because you won't show it. I'm going to draw and make the world my canvas and I'm going to lose any drawing tool that I can get my hands up. I'm going to draw and I'm going to draw and I'm going to draw and I'm going to draw and I'm going to share and share and share and share and share and draw. Just give me a pen and I'll make something. We follow the pen and you allow it to flow and you allow it to go wherever it needs to go, wherever it wants to take you. You are a willing passenger. And now you repeat that and you repeat that and you repeat that and you repeat that. Over time you get to extract what you look like. Over time you get to extract what your line feels like, coming that recognisably yours. We have this contact between our head and our hand. It does a matter of what industry you're in. It comes down to drawing, it comes down to that initial mark that you make and without this pen I wouldn't have travelled, I wouldn't have collaborated. This tool has allowed me to discover who I am. Goodbye. Did you like our movie? We worked really hard on that, I hope you enjoyed it. What are your most nervous about when it comes to being a YouTuber? I think what I'm most nervous about is continuously making and sharing and you know pulling out stuff that I'm proud of and pulling out stuff that you're proud of too. You make and you share and you make and you want to make and share and make and share and make and share. Alright, I'm going to link Shantel's channel below. Check it out, she's new, there's not a lot of stuff up there yet but it's happening. I'm a big supporter and a huge fan and I hope you guys will. You should sell those stickers, you could binkle your entire... Stick a pack, coming soon. Coming soon.",['SHANtell martin'],0.9995
1ZAPwfrtAFY,LastWeekTonight,The Trump Presidency: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO),2017-11-13 07:30:00+00:00,1430,https://youtube.com/watch?v=1ZAPwfrtAFY,97185,,12703,2418783,youtube," MUSIC The presidency of Donald Trump. The man voted least edible by Cannibal magazine six years in a row. And I know. I honestly know that the prospect of talking about Trump yet again feels exhausting. We're all so tired of him. Every room in America should have a sign on the wall that counts the number of minutes that it's been since someone brought up his fucking name. But that is the thing. Trump's presidency is like one of his handshakes. It pulls you in whether you like it or not. He has had so many terrible moments this year. You probably forgot about many of them. Remember when he creepily told the French president's wife that she was in good shape? Or when his tacky golf resort was touted on the State Department website? Or when he shoved the Prime Minister of Montenegro out of the way at a NATO event? Look how proud of himself he is. Look how proud he is. You should at least have to know that Montenegro is a country before making a move that says suck it Montenegro. And there were also quiet of it no less alarming moments. Like when he explained how hard he's been fighting to bring clean coal back, without appearing to understand what that actually is. It's just been announced that a second brand new coal mine where they're going to take out clean coal, meaning they're taking out coal, they're going to clean it, is opening in the state of Pennsylvania. Listen, is it possible that Trump is well versed in and is referring to flu gas de-sulfurization, fluidized bed combustion and selective catalytic reduction? Sure, it's possible, but let's agree, it's considerably more likely that he thinks you just take a bunch of coal and scrub a dub it with a big old sponge. Oh, yeah, that's right. I'm saying the president fundamentally doesn't as dander what he's talking about, and you know what that means. We got it! We got it! We got it! We got it! I got it! What I think that is! I got it! I thought we got it! I thought we got it in that time. Oh, that's fair, okay! You think I don't hate myself too? All right! The point is, the point is, tonight, let's pull back from the daily Trump-induced chaos and take a look at the norms that his presidency has violated and not the obvious ones, like the fact that he never released his tax returns or that his own daughter and son-in-law work in the White House, although admittedly, I am using the word work there. So, generously, that I should be able to deduct it as a charitable donation on my taxes. Or that instead of putting his assets into a blind trust to help reduce complex of interest, he simply showed America that he has many large stacks of paper presumably containing the sentence, I can't believe I'm getting away with this printed 750,000 times. Instead, we're going to talk about Trump's assault on something even more basic, the norms governing how our leaders engage with us and how in turn that affects the way that we engage with one another. It's why even the notion of getting him can feel so hopelessly futile. And let's first stipulate that it definitely doesn't help that so often what Trump says is complete nonsense. We often read transcripts of Trump's speeches and it's something that everyone should actually do once in a while because when you strip away his blindly confident, entertaining delivery and just read his words, it is staggering how incoherent he is. Here is a word-for-word reading of a speech where he talked about the Iran nuclear deal. You look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me, it would have been so easy and it's not as important as these lives are. Nuclear is so powerful. My uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago, he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right who would have thought. But when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners, now it used to be three, now it's four, but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger, fellas and it is fellas because, you know, they don't. They haven't figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so you know, it's going to take them about another 150 years, but the persons are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so and they just killed, they just killed us. LAUGHTER Holy shit! That is not a functional use of language. That is a drunk driver crashing a pickup truck full of alphabet soup. LAUGHTER Trump's actual speech patterns sound like when you write a long text by choosing only the predictive text your iPhone suggests for you. Seriously, we wrote a message like that, starting with the words, the nuclear, and here is what we got. The nuclear test programme was not opposed by the other person who knows what they want and then the delay is not being done by any other country and that is not the only way to make sure the world can do more things and things like that and gentlemen and then the other people who have been told to leave them alone with their children who are also very sad. LAUGHTER That makes exactly as much and potentially more sense than Trump's speech about what you're at nuclear deal, meaning an iPhone would be a more coherent president of the United States. But with Trump, we are familiar enough with his speech patterns that you get the basic gist of what he's trying to say. The real damage isn't in how he says things, but from three key techniques that he uses to insulate himself from criticism and consequence. And if we are not extremely careful, all three could have serious impacts that far outlast his presidency and let's start with the first one, de-legitimising the media. Now, Trump has been attacking the press since he declared his candidacy and in a broader sense, he's been waging war on the very concept of truth ever since he first turned to his mum and said, Dadda and she said, No, I'm Mama and he said, Fake News and Shit is Pants. LAUGHTER The difference now is he's crying fake news as president of the United States and he is openly proud of it to the point that he recently tried to take ownership of the term itself. The media is really the word, I think, one of the greatest of all terms I've come up with is fake. I guess other people have used it perhaps over the years, but I've never noticed it. He just took credit for inventing the term Fake News, which for the record, he did not. Meaning what he just said was technically fake, fake news news. And you can imagine him saying, Well, I'm not the first politician to criticize the press. What about Hillary Clinton? What about Barack Obama? What about Bernie Sanders? And that actually brings us to Trump's second technique, something called, What aboutism? It's the practice of changing the subject to someone else's perceived wrongdoing. Now, Trump does this all the time, most famously, when he was asked why he hadn't forcefully condemned the neo-naughties in Charlottesville and this was his response. What about the alt left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact that came charging that they came charging with clubs in their hand, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? Well, actually, no, because a Nazi killing someone with a car is so heinous. Any other issues that might be up for debate under any other circumstances kind of have to wait their turn. You can be wearing crocs with socks, but if you're using those socked crocs to kick Hitler in the balls, do you know what? I'm suddenly not so fucking focused on the footwear. Now, this technique of saying, What About is actually an old Soviet propaganda tool and the reason it is dangerous is because it implies that all actions, regardless of context, share a moral equivalency and since nobody is perfect, all criticism is hypocritical and everybody should do whatever they want. It is a depressingly effective tool, which is why, on Trump's favourite network, you hear it all the time. The mainstream media focused on the Trump campaign and allegations of collusion with the Russians. But what about the Democrats' possible ties to Moscow? Former National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn investigated for his private meeting with Russia, but what about Hillary Clinton? The media wants to call into question the credibility and the trustworthy, then, is of this administration. But what about Benghazi? What about the blatant lies that the Obama administration told us? What about the fact that Ben Rhodes bragged about lying to the media and the public about the Iran deal? What about the fact that Jonathan Gruber basically said the American people was stupid? Okay, stop, stop, stop. Because here is the thing, none of the errors those people may have made in the past excused the Trump administration's actions. A defense attorney could not stand up in court and say, maybe my client did murder those people, but I ask you this, what about Jeffrey Dahmer? What about Al Capone? What about the guy from the silence of the lambs? Are Ress Malkaitse here, people? Are Ress Malkaitse? APPLAUSE The problem with... What about evening? It doesn't actually solve a problem or win an argument. The point is just to muddy the waters, which can make the other side mad. And that actually brings us to Trump's third technique, trolling. Now, trolling itself has been around four years. It's basically 80% of what happens on the internet. It's when a YouTube commenter says something willfully provocative, like saying, I've aged like an apple caught in a dumpster or that I look like a fucking pickle with glasses. Now, it doesn't matter whether they mean any of that. The point is just to get a reaction and to hurt my feelings, which, by the way, it absolutely does. But... But Trump may well be the first ever troll to be elected president. And that's right, I said elected. Remember, 10th president, Sprinkles Fuzz Wizard? He assumed office after William Henry Harrison died. And if you're thinking, hold on, Sprinkles Fuzz Wizard was not America's 10th president. Really? Who was America's 10th president? Exactly. Let's assume on right. The point is, as a troll, Trump often does things that have no effect other than to piss office-perceived enemies, like when he tweeted this wrestling gift of himself, body slamming CNN, or attacked meek of Rizinski by saying she was bleeding badly from a facelift, or, as we mentioned earlier tonight, called a leader with nuclear weapons, short and fat. And Trump even once retweeted a claim that he was the most superior troll on the whole of Twitter, calling it a great compliment, which it is not, because sometimes, when you do something that makes a lot of people mad, it's because, and bear with me here, you're a dick. If you sneak into someone's house, and you're a mate in every heating vent, and they get mad at you, you're not an epic troll sticking it to the snowflake cucks. You just some fucking asshole. But the thing is, Trump's trolling is not actually without political value. Despite Trump's few real policy accomplishments to date, he has consistently achieved one thing, and that is making his enemies unhappy. And for many Trump supporters, that itself counts as a major victory. Just listen to how Fox and Friends reacted. After Trump freaks people out by standing with military leaders during rising tensions with North Korea, suggesting that it was the calm before the storm. Look, he's trolling the media. He is, I think, totally trolling the media there. You do something like that. Even the smile and the wink. Those of us that are sick of the status quo, the forgotten men and women who voted for President Trump, want that town to freak out. I want those reporters going, what do you mean? It's beautiful to watch. Is it? Why? I'm genuinely serious. Who benefits from mass confusion about whether or not we're about to go to war? Are there thousands of unemployed factory workers across the Midwest going, well, the plant closed down and I lost my health care, but somewhere a Washington Post reporter is scared of dying, so things are looking up, mag-a. Judging your political success on how bad you make other people feel makes just about as much sense as judging your success as a zookeeper by how many bears you fuck. Oh, wow! That is not your job. I mean, I guess it's impressive in its own way, but it's definitely not what you were supposed to be doing. And the surest proof of trolling often comes when a troll is confronted, because that's when they have to either put up or shut up. You may have heard about cases where people tracked down the source of something all for that was posted online, only to find some sullen 15-year-old who just shrugs and goes, well, I don't know why I wrote that. I just did it. Stop asking me so many questions. Well, that is basically our president now. I'll show you. Remember when Trump said that Obama had surveilled him in Trump Tower, tweeting, how low has President Obama gone to tap-pup-pup my phones? What's what happens when he was asked to justify that? Well, you saw what happened with surveillance, and I think that was inappropriate. What does that mean, sir? You can figure that out yourself. Well, the reason I asked is you said you call him sick and bad. Look, you can figure it out yourself. He was very nice to me with words, but end when I was with him, but after that there has been no relationship. But you stand by that claim about him. I don't stand by anything. I just, you can take it the way you want. OK, so let's walk through what just happened there. On the internet, he claimed that his predecessor committed an extremely serious crime, but in person, he is suddenly backing down, first saying Obama was very nice to me with words, then that I don't stand by anything, which is one of the most frighteningly nihilistic sentences a president can say. I would honestly rather hear that from a clown holding a knife than a president, because at least when a clown says I don't stand by anything, you think, yeah, that kind of makes sense, please make it quick. And look, it gets worse because that interview kept going, and Trump was explicitly given the opportunity to set the record straight for the fake news media, but he flat out refused. I just wanted to find out though, you're the president of the United States. You said he was sick and bad because he had tapped you. You can take any way you can take it any way you want. But I'm asking you, because you don't want it to be fake news. I want to hear from President Trump. You don't have to ask me, because I have my own opinions. You can have your own opinions. But I want to know your opinions. You're the president of the United States. It's enough. Thank you. Thank you very much. OK, so there is a lot, that isn't furiating about that quick. But Trump going back to his desk and pretending to work hard isn't an objectively funny thing to do. That's like your dog avoid in questions by pretending to do his taxes. You never do this. Why would you need to do it now? Look, while there is nothing new about any of these techniques, they are now coming out of the Oval Office, which not only legitimizes them, it risks them spreading, and that, sadly, is happening. Last month, Congressman Paul Gosart used all three techniques. First, he suggested in an interview that the Marching Charlotte's Bill may have been a false flag operation created by the left, which is pretty trolley behavior. And when confronted about it, he deployed the other two tools. It's all been debunked. There was no one. Not been debunked. Absolutely not debunked whatsoever. So, speak to... In the conspiracy theory that you have put out there, it has been debunked. It has not been debunked. Look at what CNN has talked about with what's going on with the Clinton administration right now with the dossier. Hardly at aspect in regards to debunk. You're not real news, you're fake news. Sir, everything you've said has been debunked. Why are you continuing to put this out there? There it is. Why are you getting it working? So, he's basically just copying Trump. And if there is one thing worse than something terrible, it's a cover band of that terrible thing. If Trump is nickel-back, that man is bickle-knack. LAUGHTER Not as good at it as the originals and a horrible sign that the disease is spreading. The problem is, if that becomes the level of discourse in this country, we are seriously and lastingly fucked. And just this week, we saw some of these techniques pushed to the absolute limit by the scandal involving Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has denied allegations of sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old when he was 32 and called them fake news. Now, what's Sean Hannity then used what aboutism to derail a discussion about it? This 14-year-old girl, purportedly according to The Washington Post, told two of her girlfriends what happened. Here's the tough question. It's real time. Do you think Bill Clinton, in retrospect, was a predator? But that is not what this discussion is about. You might as well have said, here's a tough question. If you had to guess, how many lobsters are there? Like, total in the world. Is that worth discussing? Sure. But first, let's finish talking about the Senate candidate who may have made sexual advances on a child. And look, whether Clinton engaged in predatory behaviour is absolutely a legitimate question, but it shouldn't really inform what we do about Roy Moore. And even if you believe that Democrats are guilty of a double standard, the solution is not to have no standard whatsoever. That is why it's so important to train ourselves to identify these techniques, because their natural endpoint is the erosion of our ability to decide what's important, have an honest debate, and hold one another accountable. And that erosion can be so gradual that it's difficult to spot. It's like being murdered by a sloth. It happens very slowly, and you might not notice until it's too late. Now, listen, this is all very bleak. I cannot pretend that it isn't, which is why it is so important to take some hope from this year's small victories, like the Muslim ban being blocked by the court, after massive public protests, or the attempts to repeal a barmer care stalling, thanks in part to people pressuring their lawmakers. And just this week, just this week in Virginia, voters rejected Ed Gillespie for governor after he ran a Trump-style dog whistle campaign, and that is encouraging, because it's nice to know that if you use Trump tactics in a Virginia gubernatorial election, you do not get to be gubernator. Now, further down the ballot there, Tuesday also marked the defeat of Bob Marshall, who earlier this year proposed a so-called bathroom bill. He lost to Danica Rome, who will now be Virginia's first openly transgender legislator, and the tone that she has taken is already markedly different. Danica, you were running against Robert Marshall in 13-term incumbent. He's also a man who referred to himself as Virginia's chief homophob. He refused to debate you during the campaign. Do you have anything you want to say to him? Come January, delegate Marshall will be one of my constituents, and I'm not going to disrespect my own constituents. Wow! That is incredibly refreshing. Just think about that. She beats a man who openly disrespected her, but given the opportunity, she chose not to respond by tweeting, I'll fight for Bob's rights to use any bathroom he wants, but it's too late. He already shit the bed on election day. That's sad. It's nice. It's nice not to have that. And look, Tuesday's results should not make you complacent. They are absolutely no guarantee that the midterms will turn out at all well. That is why, though, you should take these moments of encouragement to help you keep going, because the Trump presidency is basically a marathon. It's painful, it's pointless, and the majority of you didn't even agree to run it. You were just signed up by your dumbest friend. And the fact is, we're not even at mile six right now, or possibly even mile three. So there is a long way to go, and though you're exhausted, and your whole body is screaming for you to give up and your nipples are chafing for some reason, the stakes are too high for any of us to stop, and I do realise that I'm saying that as we're about to stop doing shows for the year. But here's the thing, we won't actually be going away entirely. You may remember earlier this year, we used our catheter cowboy to try and get information to the president in the ad breaks or Foxen friends. Well, Trump is still watching that show, and we know this because the Times wrote a generally negative piece about its enormous influence on him, and because of that, called it the most powerful TV show in America, a sentiment that the hosts were very excited about. This programme, the programme you're watching, is according to the New York Times, the most powerful TV show in America. You're wise, Steve, because we have the best viewers. Yes. No. No, you don't. You absolutely don't. And don't misunderstand. I'm not saying that we have the best viewers. You got... No, I'm not saying that. No, I'm explicitly not saying that. You guys are fine. LAUGHTER The best audience belongs to Ellen, because this is how they greet her. Here she is now, Ellen DeGeneres. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE None of you fuckers did that when I came out. None of you did it. For the point of the point of the read, just 45 minutes after that information was on Fox. Trump tweeted, Wow, the failing New York Times said about Fox and Friends the most powerful TV show in America. So information goes right from that show into his brain, which is terrible. Because we would genuinely be better off, if Trump was getting daily briefings from an actual Fox and his friends, a head Tom and a Weasel with its head stuck in a tin can. But if Trump is going to keep watching that show, we are going to spend our hiatus, sneaking information through our catheter cowboys. So a number of commercials are going to be airing on Fox News over the next few months. Here is the first one. Attention, catheter patients. I'm a professional cowboy. I use catheters and there's two things I know. I don't like pain when I cath. And the term clean cold doesn't refer to the physical act of clean and cold. How would be impossible? Cold is cold. Clean cold is a marketing term. The cold industry came up with for stuff like carbon capture and sequestration, an expensive process that's shown limited results at best. Also, Frederick Douglass is dead. More tomorrow. Bye-bye. That's good information, folks. I know. That will be old folks in the DC area late to this week. And keep an eye out for more of them because that cowboy has got a bunch up his sleeve. The US Virgin Islands has a governor, not a president. Here's a fun fact. There's actually no federal law against this, thanks to something called the first amendment. Just because Jared Kushner is smarter than you doesn't mean that he's smart. The Navy seals aren't actually seals. I know, buddy. I was disappointed too. There are many non-gold decor schemes that are actually very appealing. There are none of clips. Don't do this, buddy. This can't be that hard. Not easy. Bad. One fish. Two fish. Red fish. Arm of the executive branch that should operate free from White House interference so as to avoid politically motivated prosecution. Donald? Donald? I don't think he's getting any of this. That's all for now, Donald. See you tomorrow. And remember, if you're not enjoying this, there's no shame in Clinton.","['last week tonight trump presidency', '""last week tonight donald trump""', '""john oliver trump""', '""donald trump""']",0.9954
puqaWrEC7tY,Good Mythical Morning,Nickelback Lyrics: Real or Fake?,2017-11-13 11:00:04+00:00,430,https://youtube.com/watch?v=puqaWrEC7tY,10172,,2146,343168,youtube," Welcome back! Now for years, Nickelback has been the band that everybody loves to hate. It has almost become clich√© to make fun of them. And for a moment, we consider that it might be played out in poor taste to create a game that makes fun of their ridiculous lyrics. But then we decided to do it anyway. It's time for... Is this a real Nickelback lyric? Or did I write it while smoking Nickelcrack? I hope not. I don't smoke Nickelcrack Link. It's not the 80s. So then all these are really Nickelback lyrics. You just give away the game. Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to read some lyrics for you. They may be real and dumb, and that would be they're from Nickelback. They may just be really dumb, and that means I made them up. Okay. You get three right. You get three right. If you don't get at least three right, you're going to be punished with the worst thing I could think of. You're going to be forced to listen to a full Nickelback track on noise-canceling headphones and comethical more. But if you do get three right or more, I got to listen to it. That's right. Here we go, Link. Here's your first song, lyric. I need a credit card that's got no limit, and a big black jet with a bedroom minute. Gonna join the mile high club at 37,000 feet. That's it. You didn't rhyme at the end there? Yeah, well, it's got a little... Yeah. Kind of fizzled out. It probably rhymed at some other place. I'd like a big black jet. What a bedroom in it. Who wouldn't? It does exist. You know what? You know what? I think this is real. I think I have enjoyed this song in my normal life in the past. In the disnant past. Final answer? Final answer. All right, Link, your right, it is real. It's from a song called Rockstar. Let's have a listen. Rockstar. A credit card that's got no limit, and a big black jet with a bedroom minute. Gonna join the mile high club at 37,000 feet. Sounds like a country song. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nickel Creek and Nickelback should get together. They should! And make a dime. She'd come. They could call it dime piece. That could be their new album. You're off to a great start. Technically 37,000 feet, you'd be joining the 7.007 mile high club. But, you know what? Oh, you know what? Yeah. But math. Here's another one. She's so hot. She commits arson. Too sexy. She'll give you a scar, son. She's not even my number one. She's not? Arson and Scarson. Definitely, Ryan. It's got Nickelback written all over it. Nickelback two for two. All right, Link, it's fake. But it could have been. I mean, it's like somewhere right now, the songwriter for Nickelback, whatever his name is, is like, oh yeah, he's taking notes. Because I did extensive research on every song that has ever been written and no one has ever rhymed arson with Scarson. Oh, really? Yeah, that was completely original. There's a first time for everything. Here's another one. The Hourglass Man has gone away. The Hourglass Man, he's in the sand. He's in the sand. Yeah. The Hourglass Man is buried in the Hourglass. I can seem showing up. He's like, God, gather around. I've got an idea for a new track. There's a picture of a man in there. You know about an Hourglass, well, there's a man. He's in the sand. He's in the sand. Yeah. This is, it writes itself. Yes, Nickelback. Link, this is a little bit of a trick question. These are real lyrics, but they're not from Nickelback. Who is it? They're from Puddle of Mud. That's Puddle of Mud with two D's. Yeah. Not to be confused with Mud the Band or Mud to the Band. Yes, that's the thing. Or Muddy Waters, the blues musician. Not to be confused with Muddy River, a song by Johnny Rivers. Not to be confused with the Los Angeles River. Not to be confused with drinkable water. Never try to drink Nickelback. Yeah, well, that's the moral of the story. OK, here we go. Got a criminal record? Yes. No, I can't cross state lines. First on the bad list, and your last on mine. Looking for a scapegoat long past due. Walking down the aisle staring straight at you. What does it mean? Anything you want it to. Literally, that sounds like something we would have written in the wax paper dogs days. You know, it's like, it's nonsensical, and it sounds cool. Yeah. Sounds real cool. I got to keep riding my money on Nickelback. I cannot step away. All right. Nickelback. LATE, you're correct. This is from Where Do I Hide? Let's have a listen. Got a criminal record. I can't cross state lines. First on the bad list, and your last on mine. I can't take any more. I can't take any more. If you don't listen to the lyrics, which I think is the way you're supposed to enjoy it, I mean, I'm just being real. Don't be real. It was catchy. What? It was catchy back in the day. If you don't try to make sense of it, you're like, yeah, this is good, I think. I was thinking, speaking of Where Do I Hide, if anybody has an answer, let me know. But if you don't want to hide from that, I kind of liked it. OK, Link, you're two for four. So that means if you get this one right, you do not have to listen to Nickelback and I do. OK. After hours and alcohol, every club we've seen them all. As long as we don't need to stand in line, party scenes and billboard dreams that ladies love, those limousines. It's all true. It's all true. No, it's not what you're going to be. We're not going to make generalizations about ladies just because Nickelback. I'm just saying in my experience, anytime I've gotten out of a limousine and there's a lady there, she's don't or a man. But just don't say. I'm not with him on this. Ladies. Everybody loves limousines. Ladies love long cars. It's a rapper from the 80s. You know, I'm a dance with the one that brung me. It's Nickelback. You're right, Link. It's your ear. It's your ears on this. Oh, man. Laded love, the limousines. I'll become a fan. That was from the song, See You At The Show, and Nickelback, no, you won't. Really got away with melody, those nickels. Congratulations, Link. You're going to make me listen to Nickelback while you get to play with cute dogs and good mythical more. And light him up, up, up, light him up, up, up. I'm on fire. Click through because we did the impossible. We talked some old dogs, new tricks in the next step.

Yeah, the tire. Ooh, that's more gross. That is more gross. That's gonna do. Yeah, I'll do it for you. Alright, let's go. There's not here, but we're thinking about changing it from the car to this dirty trash can because it's dirty. We're changing it to a trash can. Okay. But we're gonna bump, I'm gonna say three. That's easy. How would this keep the shells in there? Just squish it. Extra point. Four? I don't vote that. Yeah, that's too many points. I would do all that for my hat. Three. He's agreed to the three, so let's just do three. Yeah. Alright, Greg, I'll let you do the honors. Broke you break this egg for me. Yeah. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

I dare you to let other players choose an item for you to brush your teeth with. Oh! Now, Parker found a broom and we're debating what to put on top of it. Yeah, you don't have to eat it, but the smell, I know. You don't like mail. So two points to do that with mail. You want three points? What's three? I can put like leg hair and stuff on there. I said three points. Okay, I'll do it. Alright, let's make it then. I hate mail, dude. How much? Get a nice one. I didn't wash my hands after the egg thing. I didn't ask it. I didn't ask it.

Yeah, check, check. You got some extra, extra hot. So we're going to test it out to see how many points it's worth. Is it hot? I can't tell if it's... I don't know if it's bad. To be honest, I can't tell. I hate spicy stuff, so... It's barely you and they're dirt. No, listen, they're... I get to feel the tingle right now. So how many points did that work? I'll say two points. Two points. For one whole round? Yep. Here we go. Ha ha ha ha. Yeah. Well, either one or two already. Oh, it looks like top ramen. Oh, this already gets 1 point now. One when it gets back to you. No, it's okay, no. Five. Hot those first days. Hot those first days! I dare you to face plant on five different things. five different things. Ooh. What? Let me ask you this. What kind of point value are you looking at? Another word three, four. When you face-time, this is like a scorpion face-time. I mean, what's a scorpion face-time? You know, like when their legs like kick up over their head. Oh, the step-boys won. What? I don't know that. What do you mean? It's the same face. What is a face-time to you then? Why I just put my face on the ground, right? On that thing? What? That's putting your face on the ground. Face-time is like this. That's a face-time, yeah. Yeah. You want to show your eye on it a little bit? All right, just get it. We'll see what it is. We've got some flour, and then we've got some vacuum dirt. And a little bit of the seasoned salt. Oh.

It's not too late. Uh-oh. Something. Tarotcha. Oh, I smell it. It's like a tomato shot. Oh. Why would you drink it like that? All right. Great. I told you it was going to hurt. It's just like, went down wrong tube. Oh, that was burned. Yeah. I wasn't on. He's using the... Oh. Oh. Here it is. Back to Derek. Zero point Derek, they call him. Feel they have with Legos and where they do a head spin. Where's the Legos at? Upstairs. So we adjusted it because Derek is a break dancer. We're going to let Derek break dance. The 20 seconds. He's going to have to put on socks and gloves. Feel with Legos. So we get a show at Easy Pain. Let's do it. Go. How many points is this? Oh, we decided after we see that. Five, six, seven, start. Oh.

gHZ1Qz0KiKM,iJustine,2 Weeks with iPhone X,2017-11-13 19:07:23+00:00,833,https://youtube.com/watch?v=gHZ1Qz0KiKM,9763,,1434,119180,youtube," Hey guys, how's it going? It's just team back with more iPhone videos. I know, I know. I definitely posted a lot during launch week and a lot of you guys who have subscribed for vlogs or cooking videos. We're like, oh, what's happening? For most of you guys who know me, I'm sure you weren't surprised. I had planned on doing a week with iPhone, but I felt like I had posted so many videos within a week that I thought maybe I would just wait and do a two weeks with iPhone. So here we are. It's been about two weeks since I got the iPhone 10. It really is a beautiful device. So the first week that I had it was basically filming and shooting and editing videos about the phone. So I didn't really feel like I got a chance to try it out and use it in sort of an everyday normal setting like I normally would. So during our testing week, we tried out a bunch of things. The first thing that we tried out that I didn't even share on my channel because my sister posted the video is we did an underwater test. Would face ID work underwater? And number two, would your phone actually work underwater? The answer is no. It doesn't. The screen doesn't work underwater. Since this was her video, she volunteered to use her phone to do this test. Currently, her phone is still working perfectly fine. The iPhone 10 is rated to be able to withstand at least 30 minutes underwater. It's recommended that you don't go past 3.3 feet, which thankfully the pull that we were in was about 3 feet because my sister dropped her phone and we both were like, no! Um... Oh no! No! No! No! It proved to be quite difficult to go underwater. Try to keep your eyes open while swiping up and trying to see if the phone is actually responding to your face. In this test, we did conclude that the phone does not work underwater. You weren't able to swipe up, but also didn't recognize her face. We did have some difficulties with face ID trying to recognize each of us with sunglasses on in very bright conditions. So the reason for this is because if it's super reflective, the phone is unable to see your eyes in this bright light. And if you have the attention awareness on, if you can't see your eyes, it's not going to unlock your phone. The way that you can get around this is turning off the attention awareness. So basically, you won't have to look at your phone. This does make face ID a little bit less secure, so that means if somebody comes up to you, they can swipe up and unlock your phone. With attention awareness on, if somebody tried to do that to you, you would have to be looking at it for it to unlock. It has been a little bit frustrating when I'm outside walking my dog with my sunglasses on and it's super bright. I'm trying to use face ID and it's not unlocking and then he's pulling me super hard, going to the bathroom and then I'm trying to clean the bathroom up. And I'm trying to use my phone and unlock and it's not working. So normally, if I feel like I'm going to be in a situation where I'm going to have sunglasses on, it's super bright. I do turn off the attention awareness. But for the most part, I have been keeping it on because it is an extra layer of security. Other than that, I've been pretty impressed with face ID. I know a lot of people have been saying that they're having problems. Some of my friends are saying it's not recognizing me. It's taking too long. Even at first, my sister was having an issue where it was taking a while to recognize her. And I think the reason for this is a lot of people when they first set up their phones. It says, hey, it's face ID time, set it up. And you're kind of in a hurry. You want to set up your phone. You're not really paying attention. You're just sort of moving your head around. And I feel like that first setup, it doesn't get a really good read on your face. So if you are having this problem, I definitely recommend going back in, rescading your face and seeing if that helps. Another thing that I tried was what if I looked like a zombie? What if my face was completely unrecognizable? Will face ID recognize me? I decided to go all out. I had this incredible special effects makeup artist, Dan Gilbert come to my house, make me look like a zombie, and see if we could fool the face ID. Now, one of the things that I read in the comments is a lot of you guys were suspect because you said, justine, during this whole process, you were unlocking your face from beginning to end. And the thing with face ID is it learns your face. So perhaps this entire time that I was getting my makeup done, I was unlocking my phone. Maybe the phone was learning my face throughout the whole process, which is a very, very, very, very, very valid point. And to that, I don't really know. I don't know if that's the case. Now, the reason that I decided to obscure most of the bottom of my face is because that previous day that I'd met Dan, we did something for another shoot where I was a zombie and I obscured most of my eyes and most of my forehead. So I thought if it unlocked with most of the top of my face obscured, it's got to be something down here. One of the things that I did notice is that when you turn off the attention awareness, is it's not actively seeking for your eyes. So it does unlock your phone a little bit faster. So again, if you are having some issues with it unlocking slow, or it's not recognizing your face, try turning that off, try rescuing, and let me know if that works for you. Going back to the sunglasses, I tested out probably like 15 to 20 pairs of sunglasses to see if they would unlock. But I was right here in a controlled environment where there's no sunlight. It's my studio light. So with that, I'm not having a lot of reflection. So all of those sunglasses worked indoors. But did they work outdoors? And not so much. I also heard the people were saying if they are able to unlock their phone using their reflection in the mirror. Hmm, let's try it. It unlocked. Yes, it works! So it looks like Face ID does work with a reflection of yourself in the mirror. Interesting. But it doesn't work with a printout and picture of yourself. One of the things that I was worried about with this phone is because it's so much smaller and I was so used to having the plus size phones that I wasn't going to like this as much as I do. Surprisingly, having a smaller phone is incredible. I can fit it so much easier into my purses, into my pants pockets, into my yoga pants. I've got like a little side pocket thing when I'm running or hiking or not really running mostly just walking the dog around the block. It's so great to not have such a massive phone like I previously did. So the form factor of the 10 is comparable to an iPhone 8 or any of those phones that are that size. But the screen size is actually larger than the iPhone 8 Plus. Which kind of puts this in the most perfect sweet spot for the size of a phone. And I know what you're saying. What about the notch? Do you love it? Do you hate it? Honestly, I am not really sure. I feel like I'm kind of 50-50 because there are some times where I'm like, man, just don't. I'm trying to watch something and then there's a little notch is there and it's like, why are you there? Just, uh, but then other times it does fit pretty seamless with apps so I don't really notice it. But to say that I don't notice it all, I would completely be lying because it's there. Like, I don't know how you can't see it. Like, if you don't see this, then I don't know what you're looking at because it's there. The notch is there. But if they were to remove the notch, I don't think I would be upset at all. I think that I would be okay if it wasn't there. I mean, I see why they have to have the notch here because there's really nowhere else to put it. If they didn't put the notch there, then there would have to be some sort of a black bar up here just to how everything that is inside of this notch. Proximity sensor, it has the true depth camera, speakers, cameras, got so many things inside of that little notch. They, I mean, I get it, but how are they going to get rid of it for the next phone? Or are they not? Or is this, is this the new normal? I thought that I would be taking a ton of front-facing portrait selfies, but to be honest, I really haven't taken very many. I guess in the past week I've just kind of been playing Call of Duty, so that's really not something that's very interesting to take pictures of. Especially a front-facing selfie. My friend Joey said he's returning his iPhone 10. Number one, because he wasn't a huge fan of the Face ID and number two, because the camera quality was too good, and I 100% get where he's coming from. Because when you take a front-facing picture now, I mean, it sees everything. It's like, what? I've taken tons of photos of my dog. I've taken, what have I been taking pictures of? I don't even know, honestly. Since I got through the iPhone release week, I've basically been playing video games, and it's been great. So yeah, I'm looking through here. I haven't really done a whole lot the past few days. Here's a cute picture of my baby boy, Doggie, and his friend, Yosey. I'm gonna picture my wine fridge while that's really exciting. Oh, here's a picture of me, and Alex Clark. We did a fun video, the Whisper Challenge video, and we unboxed a very fun Star Wars Jedi Challenge game. I'm going outside some wine. I had a LAN party, more pictures of the dog. Yeah, I basically have it done a lot. So other than taking pictures of my dog, I've been very, very impressed with the new Snapchat filters. Now granted, I don't really use Snapchat as much as I used to. I feel like most of the time when I'm going to post something on Snapchat, I end up just posting it on my Instagram stories. But I decided to hop into Snapchat and test out the face tracking features that they have now with some of their face filters, and they are very, very accurate. I was very shocked. Hey guys, how's it going? I'm just shooting some videos here, but I was testing out that a Snapchat face tracking on the iPhone 10, so it's very, very, very good. So here's another one with glasses on. Like, look at this, like I move it, and it does. I'm so impressed. I'm impressed. Oh yeah, this is, this is great. Oh gosh. So that one thing that Snapchat did right is get in early, get the face tracking features, and really implement that to the max on Snapchat. Let's see. What else have I been doing? I mean, the phone is obviously so much faster than the 7, although I did kind of have that middle phone, I had the iPhone 8 between the 10, so having the jump from the 8 to the 10 didn't really have an overall feeling of that much difference. Because both of those phones, the insides are basically the same thing. Also, the camera quality on the 8 is almost identical to the 10. Being able to have the slow-mo options to go up to 240 at 1080 is pretty great. Although I don't really use it that often, but I have found that I've been vlogging a lot more on my iPhone, because every time I go to vlog, I either don't have my vlogging camera or the battery is dead. And a lot of you guys didn't really notice a difference when I went from this to the other one. Of course, I can tell because I'm the one filming and editing, and the front facing camera on here is obviously not as good as the 4K Sony that I used to film with. But overall, the audio on this thing is great. The video quality looks amazing. The photos look incredible. Almost too good and too realistic. The battery life, I haven't really noticed that it's been worse than the 8 or the 7, mostly because I'm always carrying around a Mofie, so I'm unaware of battery life ever. I don't know if it even gets close to being red, I'm plugging this thing in. I've also really loved having wireless charging. I have one by my bed. I have one by my desk over there, and I even have this one over here, which has been my charger of choice, the Mofie wireless charger. So I use this one of my desk and this one, I kind of just move around throughout the house wherever I happen to be. And in my bedroom, I have the Belkin one. I'm not really sure why I decided to do that. I feel like I like the look of this one, and it's a lot smaller than the Belkin. I have some white lamps in my bedrooms. I felt like the white matched a little bit better, but it really is nice just being able to roll over from my phone on the charger. I not have to worry if it's plugged in or if the dog is gonna jump down and knock the cord off the bed. It's been pretty great, so I know. Welcome to steam to wireless charging. Why? Did the Pixel 2 decide not to do wireless charging? I'm so confused. I feel like they rushed the Pixel 2 out, just to be like, here's our phone. Here it is. It's ready, but it wasn't. It wasn't ready. I will say the front facing Pixel 2 portrait mode is really, really good. I did a couple tests of that, and I'll be doing a future video here, hopefully very, very soon of the no date, the Pixel 2, and the iPhone 10. Doing a little photo comparison, video comparison. I know a bunch of people have already done it, but I'm a little bit late. Either way, even if I didn't do this video for you guys, I would be doing this for myself anyway, so I just kinda wanna test it out and see for myself what kind of results will I get? Stay tuned for that. So I guess I should probably talk about some of the things that I don't like about the new iPhone 10, and there's not very many, I know what you're saying. Just the end of your bias, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. This is my video. I'm telling you the things that I like and I don't like. One of the things that I absolutely do not like at all and it's been driving me insane is closing apps. Now Apple says that you don't have to close apps because it doesn't really make a difference. It's not gonna kill your battery, it's not gonna do this, it's not gonna do that. Well, I like to close them. I like to be able to just go and swipe right down here at the bottom, see the things that I have open, not everything that I've opened in the past two months. So the problem now is to close apps. You have to swipe up and you just hold, and there's a delay. Now normally you would be able to just swipe up from here to close, but now you have to hold in and then swipe up or hit this little button right here. So it definitely takes a few extra seconds just to close some apps when before it used to be super quick. Of course this is a software thing so that is a very, very easy fix. Hopefully in a future update of iOS 11. Oh gosh, speaking of updates. Wow, the biggest troll I feel like in internet history was the iOS bug where it turned the letter I to like an A with a question mark or something. There was a bunch of different things that were happening. You would type a specific character whether it was an A or an I and then you would hit send. And in that sending process between you typing it and actually hitting send on Twitter or Instagram or wherever, this would appear. And most of the times when you were typing it, you wouldn't actually see it until you hit send or you posted whatever it was you were posting. And this infected everyone because it wasn't just an iPhone X thing, it was an iOS update. And it took them probably like four days maybe to fix it which I feel like is a pretty long time, especially when the entire internet was just crumbling at our fingertips. Most people on Android couldn't see the issue so a lot of them were very confused as to what we were all complaining about or what we were seeing. The struggle was real. Thankfully that update has been updated so if you guys haven't updated to the latest software update on your iPhones, please, please too. It will save us all so much hassle. So I guess that's it. I really don't have much more to say that I haven't already said or I haven't already posted in a previous video. If you guys wanna watch all of those videos, I'll put a link in the description where you can check out my iPhone X playlist. There's tons of fun videos there if you haven't seen them already. And if you have seen them, thank you. I appreciate it. Be sure to subscribe because I have a bunch of fun holiday videos coming up which I'm very excited about. Also some more fun tech videos, some gaming videos. I know a lot of you guys have been requesting an Nintendo Switch video so yes, that is coming very, very shortly as well. I feel so bad I do so many things on this channel that when somebody gets super excited about something and they subscribe off of that specific video and then I don't do that thing again for a very long time. I just hope that you guys can find some entertainment in something here and that's really my only wish, really. With that being said, I'm gonna go and edit this video now. So I will see you guys later. Bye.","['ijustine', '""week with iPhone X""', '""iphone x""', '""apple""', '""iphone""', '""iphone x review""', '""iphone x unboxing""']",0.9999
